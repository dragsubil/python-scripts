PageSaver for the Worm (parahumans.wordpress.com)
Will download all the chapters as web pages using the included table.html file and save it locally in directory 'pages'.
Will also change the hyperlinks at the "Last Chapter" and "Next Chapter" to point to the chapter pages stored locally.
Also creates a new tableofcontents.html with local links to all the chapters downloaded in the directory 'pages'.


The above will happen. Probably. Maybe. I don't know. You might get porn instead.

Requires python 3.x

To run the program:
1. cd to the directory the program is saved in
2. Run 'python pagesaver.py'
3. When prompted, type 'table.html' for downloading all chapters. Type 'sampletable.html' if you want to give it a test run.
4. Go read a book, this might take a while
5. Go to the pages directory and start reading from the first chapter or go to a particular chapter using the tableofcontents.html file.

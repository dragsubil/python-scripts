#PageSaver for the Worm Web Serial (parahumans.wordpress.com)
<img src=https://parahumans.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cityscape2.jpg></img>


Will download all the chapters as web pages using the included table.html file and save it locally in directory 'pages'.

Will also change the hyperlinks at the "Last Chapter" and "Next Chapter" in each chapter page to point to the chapter pages stored locally.

Also creates a new tableofcontents.html with local links to all the chapters downloaded in the directory 'pages'.

This will also work for other web serials which have a similar table of contents page as Worm has (provided you have saved the required table of contents html file in the same directory).

Only requires python 3.x. No other dependencies.

##Running the program

1. cd to the directory the program is saved in
2. Run 'python pagesaver.py'
3. When prompted, type 'table.html' for downloading all chapters. Type 'sampletable.html' if you want to give it a test run.
4. Go read a book, this might take a while
5. Go to the pages directory and start reading from the first chapter or go to a particular chapter using the tableofcontents.html file.
